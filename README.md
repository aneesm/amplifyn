# DxDy WordPress Starter Kit

Timber, ACF and other common plugins. Built off of Pantheon upstream so this can be pushed there in directly.

To compile styles and scripts, minify images and build spritemap: `cd wp-content/themes/dxdy` then `npm install` and then `gulp build` or `npx gulp build`.

To recompile on code update: set the correct base URL on the `gulpfile` and then `gulp watch`.
